🕶⚠️ PLEASE WEAR PROTECTIVE EYEWEAR TO PREVENT RETINAL DAMAGE ⚠️🕶

Excuse me, {sir/sirette}, for the disturbance, but a recent letter from the Department of Repository Titles under the Institue of Bruh has issued a warning about what seems to be a ☢️ BRUH SITUATION ☢️ in the title of this repository.

1. {The word or sequence of phonemes that can be uttered in isolation}

2. {Phonetic notation, as defined within the Internation Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)}

3. _{The origin from which the word is derived}_

4. > {An explanatory or typical use of the word}

To resolve the issue, please adhere to the norms and conventions as defined by the Oxford Dictionary, as originally written and published as of February 1, 1884.

The members of the Department of Repository Titles collectively hope that this issue will be resolved shortly and that any seemingly inevitable declaration of martial law will be unnecessary.
