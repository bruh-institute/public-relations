Excuse me, {sir/sirette}, for the disturbance, but a recent letter from the Department of Repository Contents under the Institue of Bruh has issued a warning about what seems to be a ☢️ BRUH SITUATION ☢️ in the contents of this repository.

What the repository should look like:

```
.
├── README.md
├── code/
├── folders/
└── here/
```

What it looks like:

```
Ę̶̡̡̡͖̲̣͉͎̼̱̤͈̝̀̀̓́͌͂m̸̹̯͉̯̞̺̑̿̾͒̑̀̚͠p̴̛͚̝͖̯̱͈̭͌̾̑͗̌̀̈́͑̇̈́̏̕͜͝t̴̛̤͖̝̣̻̯̻̗͔͔̾͊̂͌̕͠y̸̢̢̙͓̖͓̟̬̩̤͓̺̼͈͖͈̦̝̑͌̊̊͌̇͊͋̒̃̄̕
```

To resolve the issue, please adhere to the norms and conventions as defined by Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie, as originally researched until the late 2000s.

The members of the Department of Repository Contents collectively hope that this issue will be resolved shortly and that any seemingly inevitable declaration of martial law will be unnecessary.
